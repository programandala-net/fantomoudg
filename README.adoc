== Name

"FantomoUDG" stands for "Forth ANomalistic Tools Of Manipulation Of
UDG", where "UDG" stands for "User Defined Graphics"; beside,
"fantomo" is the Esperanto word for "ghost".

== History

Some simple tools to manipulate and convert UDG were written in 2011,
2013 and 2015, for specific needs.

In 2016 the tools were put together to prepare a coherent toolkit, and
a Git repository was created from development backups in order to
resume the development.
